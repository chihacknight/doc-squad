# doc-squad

This is a volunteer project at [Chi Hack Night](http://chihacknight.org/) with the goal of making volunteer open-source projects more inclusive through better documentation. Once we have some basic content set up, we'll start actively improving docs for specific projects in Chicago.

**Current Status**: content under construction. volunteers *extremely* welcome!!

## Content

### 1. [ReadMe Template](https://github.com/chihacknight/doc-squad/blob/master/readme_template.md) *(in progress)*
**WHAT**: A template to copy/paste into all github projects  
**WHY**: To help people populate content & to explicitly call out what's missing

### 2. [Content Guidelines](https://github.com/chihacknight/doc-squad/blob/master/content_guidelines.md) *(in progress)*
**WHAT**: Content guidelines for documenting projects, to go hand in hand with the ReadMe template  
**WHY**: To have a comprehensive, living set of guidelines that isn't hard-coded into the readme template

### 3. Beginner's Contribution Guide *(coming soon)*
**WHAT**: A friendly intro to github, open-source, etc that all documentation for volunteer projects should link to  
**WHY**: GitHub is unfriendly to anyone who isn't a developer, i.e. most people. Volunteer civic projects shouldn't assume GitHub savvy

## How to use this
